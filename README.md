# wstrade-api

A tiny Unofficial Wealthsimple Trade API Wrapper for JavaScript, supporting the core abilities of the Wealthsimple Trade application including placing orders, viewing and cancelling orders, and more.

## Disclaimer

* **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**. This is an unofficial Wealthsimple Trade API Wrapper.
*  **DO NOT LEVERAGE THIS IN ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT ORDERLY MARKET FUNCTIONS**. This package is provided to you so you can
build cool shit with it, but you should understand that you have a responsibility to not engage in illegal trading behaviours that can disrupt orderly market functions.

## Server-Side Limitation

This wrapper will not work when executed on the client-side due to the underlying CORS security limitation imposed by the Wealthsimple Trade endpoints.
If you wish to build a front-end application, you will have to design an architecture where the server
does all of the API calls.

## Getting Started

Before playing with **wstrade-api**, you must have a valid
Wealthsimple Trade account to authenticate against. If you have not signed up for Wealthsimple Trade, you may download the iOS application [here](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/wealthsimple-trade/id1403491709) or the android application [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wealthsimple.trade&hl=en_CA).

### Prerequisites

You just need node.js — and npm, obviously.

### Dependencies

The dependency list is tiny — **node-fetch** and **source-map-support**. They will be automatically installed when you install `wstrade-api` through `npm`.

### Installing

Install **wstrade-api** from the npm registry

```
npm i wstrade-api
```

You could also clone the GitHub repository
