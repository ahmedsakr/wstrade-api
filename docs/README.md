Importing `wstrade-api` with CommonJS, ES6
===
There is no default export in `wstrade-api`. Instead, the `wstrade-api` exports the modules independently. Below are examples of importing `wstrade-api` with CommonJS or ES6 notations.

**CommonJS**
```javascript

/**
 ** Pattern 1 **
 **/

const trade = require('wstrade-api');

// All modules are in the trade object.
console.log(trade);
//  {
//    auth:     { .. },
//    headers:  { .. },
//    accounts: { .. },
//    orders:   { .. },
//    quotes:   { .. },
//    data:     { .. },
//    config:   { .. },
//  }

// You can start accessing modules directly like this.
trade.auth.<..>;
trade.orders.<...>;


/**
 ** Pattern 2 **
 **/

// You can selectively choose what modules to bring in to your
// file.
const { auth, orders } = require('wstrade-api');

// and then use them independently!
auth.<..>;
orders.<..>;
```

**ES6/TypeScript**
```javascript

/**
 ** Pattern 1 **
 **/

// Since there is no default export, we will have to import
// all and give it a name.
import * as trade from 'wstrade-api';

// and then you can start accessing the modules in this namespaced fashion.
trade.auth.<..>;
trade.orders.<..>;


/**
 ** Pattern 2 **
 **/

// Bring in the required modules in this compact destructured notation.
import { auth, orders } from 'wstrade-api';

// and then use them independently!
auth.<..>;
orders.<..>;
```
