Headers
===
`wstrade-api` handles the network-level protocol for talking to WealthSimple Trade endpoints without any necessary intervention from you. However, in rogue usecases that I cannot think of, you might need to override this with custom headers. 

The `headers` module provides you with extensibility to configure custom HTTP headers on all endpoint calls to WealthSimple Trade. 99.9% of `wstrade-api` users won't be using this module at all. However, it is still useful to know about its existence.

The `headers` module could act as insurance in events where WealthSimple Trade starts to require a certain header to be present that is not available in an older version of `wstrade-api`, for example.
